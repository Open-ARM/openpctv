PKG_LONGDESC="Unclutter is a program which runs permanently in the background of an X11 session.  It checks on the X11 pointer (cursor) position every few seconds, and when it finds it has not moved (and no buttons are pressed on the mouse, and the cursor is not in the root window) it creates a small sub-window as a child of the window the cursor is in."
